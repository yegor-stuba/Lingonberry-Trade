# cv_5 Tasks


### Task 1: Inheritance Implementation (Person and Student Classes)
- Created a `Person` class with `name` and `age` attributes.
- Implemented a `Student` class inheriting from `Person`, adding a `studentID` attribute.
- Overrode the `getDescription()` method to include the student's ID.

### Task 2: Polymorphism with Shape Classes
- Implemented a `Shape` abstract class with subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`.
- Each subclass provides its own implementation of the `calculateArea()` method.

### Task 3: Abstraction
- **Part 1: Compile-time Abstraction (Method Overloading)**
    - Created a `Printer` class with overloaded `print` methods for different argument types.
- **Part 2: Runtime Abstraction (Method Overriding)**
    - Created an abstract `Figure` class with subclasses `Polygon` and `Octagon`.

### Task 4: Combining Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- Implemented an abstract `Animal` class with subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`.
- Demonstrated polymorphism with `makeSound()` method.
